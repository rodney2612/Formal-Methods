 HW#3 [Mini Project, Due: 16 April, 2018] 

1.	You need to state and verify the obvious safety and liveness properties (see the second reference) and also the self-stabilization 		property (also called convergence in the second reference) of the algorithm.

2.	You should try to verify the algorithm for four processes, and then see what happens when you increase the number of processes.

3.	You should think about the fairness assumptions that are necessary for the verification.

4.	For extra credit, model and verify the synchronous version of the algorithm, where all processes execute their steps in a lock-step 		fashion.

5.	You will be required to give a demo to the TAs and answer questions about your work
